  I'm Anna, an [OU environmental
  science](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/science/degrees/bsc-natural-sciences-environmental-science-q64-env)
  student with a special interest in moths. This site is to keep a track of
  everything moth related, like the moths in my garden, articles and books I
  read and events I attend.


  The main purpose is to reflect as I learn, but I hope it may prove to be a
  useful resource for others.
