Friday night is [Garden Moth Scheme](http://www.gardenmoths.org.uk/) night and was the first in 2021 for any moths to turn up in my garden. Despite "no moths" still being useful data for the scheme, it was satisfying to wake up to sixteen moths of four different species. The temperature went from 4.5 - 8.4Â°C well above freezing but not exactly warm, the covering of cloud and waxing crescent moon no doubt helped.
